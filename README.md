# Cornell Theory Reading Group: Spring 2025 (Reinforcement Learning)

This repository contains the code for replications of exercises and examples from the book [_Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (2nd Edition)_](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html) by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto. Code is written in either Julia or Python. If possible, it's nice to have both implementations but time constraints exist. When possible, .tex files and the generated pdfs for presentation are included in the relevant chapters.

When contributing -- please add your name to the list of contributors and the MIT license. Please remember to pull before pushing, and to work inside the folders for your chapter. If you're adding a new chapter, please create the folder first. Add the relevant code from Shangtong's repository so that we can compare. If you've never used git before, [email me](mailto:gs754@cornell.edu) and I can help.
